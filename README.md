# GDP Analysis
In this notebook I have analyzed time series data regarding GDP all around the world. 
1) Data Handling: cleaning the data and getting it ready for further analysis
2) Data Visualization: use of the libraries matplotlib, seaborn and folium for different visualization of change of GDP over time and across countries
3) Supervised Machine Learning: through Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression algorithms I try to predict the current GDP. I also try to add other meaningful variables to see if they improve the prediction
4) Unsupervised Machine Learning: using PCA and k-means I first try to see if some of the added components aren't as relevant and then I cluster countries based on the data of a specific year
